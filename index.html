  <h2>Chinese New Year is on this Friday. So here I will introduce some fun facts about the CNY. </h2>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <ol>
      <p>There are 12 Chinese zodiacs. This year is a dog <svg class="elements"><use xlink:href="classical-elements.svg#dog" /></svg>year.</p>
      <p>Fish <svg class="elements"><use xlink:href="classical-elements.svg#fish" /></svg> is a metaphor in Chinese New Year, means "the left". The deeper meaning is that wish you had some left (of money) at the end of the year.</p>
      <!-- <p>福 <svg class="elements"><use xlink:href="classical-elements.svg#fu" /></svg> is another character that is popular in China. It means luck. A lot of people put the 福 poster upside down on the wall, because that means the luck is coming.</p> -->
      <p>Coins <svg class="elements"><use xlink:href="classical-elements.svg#coins" /></svg> and firecrackers <svg class="elements"><use xlink:href="classical-elements.svg#firecracker" /></svg> are two essential items in CNY. There is also another symbol
        to represent the coins in China:<svg class="elements"><use xlink:href="classical-elements.svg#coin2" /></svg>. Parents and the elders will give the kids some coins, and they will light the firecrackers together!</p>
    </ol>
  </ul>
