Hello, this is Freda here.
I extended this SVG project from my classmate Zeyao Li.
You can click [here](http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~zl1279/drawing/assignment2)to see his original project on i6.
You can also click [here](https://github.com/zeyaoli/SVG-Project)to see his original repository on Github.

The new SVG icon I added is redbag.svg as part of the original Chinese New Year Themed icon system.
